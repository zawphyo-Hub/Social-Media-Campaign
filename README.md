## Lessons Learned

- This project marked my first experience using **PHP**, where I learned fundamental syntax and core functions such as echo, working with variables, control structures, and how to embed PHP within HTML.
- Developing the search functionality using **PHP and MySQL** greatly improved my understanding of how to connect a web application to a database. I learned how to write SQL queries, fetch data, and display it dynamically on a web page based on user input.

## Evaluation 
This was my first project built using the PHP language, and it provided a strong foundation in both frontend and backend web development. Throughout the project, I was able to apply what I learned in real-world scenarios such as building a search functionality, managing content dynamically, and connecting to a database using PhpMyAdmin.
