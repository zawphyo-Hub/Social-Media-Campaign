            <div class="basiclive-info">
                <p><span>Platform Settings</span> Dive deep into your chosen platform's privacy settings. Control who can view your stream (public, friends-only, private) and limit who can interact with you (chat, comments).</p>
                <p><span>Location:</span>Keep your location private! Don't reveal your address, specific landmarks, or anything that could pinpoint your real-world location during a stream.</p>
                <p><span>Think Before You Share:</span>Be mindful of what you show in the background of your stream. It's best to avoid revealing personal information like family photos or bills.</p>
